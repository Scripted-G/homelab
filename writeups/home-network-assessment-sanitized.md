# Home Network Security Assessment

## Overview
Conducted a comprehensive security assessment of a home network to identify connected devices, open ports, and potential security vulnerabilities. This exercise demonstrates network reconnaissance techniques and device identification methodologies used in professional security assessments.

## Objective
- Map all devices on the home network
- Identify open ports and running services
- Assess security posture of networked devices
- Practice reconnaissance and enumeration techniques

## Lab Environment
- **Environment Type:** Personal home network (authorized testing)
- **Attack Platform:** Kali Linux Virtual Machine with Nmap
- **Network Type:** Standard residential network with mixed devices

## Tools Used
- **Nmap** - Network scanning and service detection
- **curl** - HTTP/API interaction and testing
- **telnet** - Service connection testing
- **MAC Vendor Lookup** - Device manufacturer identification

## Network Information
- **Network Range:** [REDACTED]/24
- **Gateway:** [REDACTED]
- **Scan Host:** [REDACTED] (Pop!_OS workstation)
- **Total Devices Found:** 14 active hosts

## Methodology

### Phase 1: Network Discovery

**Initial network scan to identify live hosts:**
```bash
nmap [NETWORK_RANGE]
```

**Results:**
- 14 hosts discovered on the network
- Mixture of network infrastructure, IoT devices, and personal computers

### Phase 2: Service Enumeration

**Detailed service scan on devices with open ports:**
```bash
nmap -sV [target-ip]
```

**Comprehensive port scan (all 65,535 ports):**
```bash
nmap -sV -p- [target-ip]
```

### Phase 3: Device Identification

**MAC address lookup for unknown devices:**
- Used macvendors.com to identify device manufacturers
- Cross-referenced with known household devices

### Phase 4: Security Assessment

**Attempted API interaction and service enumeration:**
```bash
curl http://[target-ip]:[port]
telnet [target-ip] [port]
```

# Device information query (allowed)
curl http://[DEVICE_IP]:8060
# Returns device XML information

# App list query (blocked)
curl http://[DEVICE_IP]:8060/query/apps
# Returns: "ECP command not allowed in Limited mode"

# Remote control attempts (blocked)
curl -d '' http://[DEVICE_IP]:8060/keypress/Home
# No response - command blocked
```

## Security Analysis

### Overall Network Security Posture: GOOD

**Strengths:**
1. **Minimal Open Ports** - Most devices have no exposed services
2. **Authentication Required** - Network devices require login credentials
3. **IoT Security Controls** - Smart devices use proprietary protocols with limited attack surface
4. **Roku Limited Mode** - Prevents unauthorized remote control
5. **Workstation Security** - Personal computer properly locked down

**Observations:**
1. **Three-tier network infrastructure** - ISP modem + WiFi repeaters for coverage
2. **Mixed device ecosystem** - Network infrastructure, IoT devices, streaming devices, personal computers
3. **Proper segmentation** - Devices only expose necessary services
4. **Access controls functioning** - Web interfaces require authentication

### Attack Surface Assessment

**Low Risk Devices:**
- Personal workstation - All ports closed
- Mobile devices - No services exposed
- Roku streaming device - Limited Mode prevents abuse

**Medium Risk Devices:**
- Router/Gateway - Standard risk; requires strong password
