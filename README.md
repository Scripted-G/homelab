# Homelab

Hands-on cybersecurity practice environment for vulnerability assessment, penetration testing, and security operations. This repository documents my journey in building practical offensive and defensive security skills through controlled lab exercises.

## 🎯 Purpose

This homelab serves as a safe, isolated environment where I can:
- Practice penetration testing methodologies
- Exploit known vulnerabilities in a controlled setting
- Document security assessments and findings
- Develop security automation scripts
- Build hands-on experience for SOC Analyst and penetration testing roles

## 🛠️ Lab Environment

**Virtualization Platform:** KVM/QEMU on Arch Linux

**Virtual Machines:**
- **Kali Linux** - Primary attacking machine with penetration testing tools
- **Metasploitable 2** - Intentionally vulnerable target for exploitation practice
- **Windows Server 2022 - Learning Active Directory and Windows server administration
- **Windows 11 - Windows client for domain testing and endpoint practice
- **Network Configuration** - Isolated virtual network for safe testing

**Key Tools Used:**
- Metasploit Framework
- Nmap
- Wireshark
- Netcat
- Burp Suite
- Various Kali Linux tools
